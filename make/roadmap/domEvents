For dom events - all event classes must provide uniformal wrapper for qualified event handling
classes:
xs.dom.event.*
static methods:
Event.on(xs.dom.Element)
Event.off(xs.dom.Element)

event handlers are stored automatically inside xs.domElement, off handlers are called automatically when element is destroyed
