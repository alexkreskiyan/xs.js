1. Stream
1.1 Common
Stream is a stream of events, produced by some event emitter
Stream is constructed with:
- subscriber
- unsubscriber
Streams can be transformed and combined
Streams are infinite, but are endable
Streams are destroyable and endable (destroy leads to stream end, but not visa versa)
Each stream transformation/combination produces a new stream
1.2 Event emitters

2. Property
2.1
Property is value-over-time, value, that changes over time, notifying it's listeners about that
Properties can be transformed and combined
Properties are infinite
Properties are destroyable
Each property transformation/combination produces a new property

-----------
Property:
class:
-fromEvent(element, eventName) //DONE
instance:
toStream([sendCurrent]) //DONE
map(fn)
reduce(fn, [memo])
filter(handler)
transform(function(source, set, end, value) {

})
throttle(wait)
debounce(wait)
transduce(transducer)

Stream:

-fromEvent(element, eventName) //DONE
instance:

//TODO Reactive combines via pure constructors
//TODO rewrite fromPromise to use private functions
